# sql-challenge
For this challenge I started analyzing the csv files in order to create the Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables.
Then i went to the recommended website and created the ERD.
After that i went to create my sql file for the tables schemas with the correct foreign and primary keys.
When it was all ready, I attached the cdv files to their matching tables previously created with the code.
To finish, I created my queries sql file to retrieve the desired information.
